        Hi I am Tim Knapp. I am a software engineer in Lehi, Utah. I enjoy adding life and personality to web and mobile applications through creative design, style and functionality. I also find fulfillment in building projects and businesses. I primarily work in React and React Native but am open to learning new languages and technologies.
